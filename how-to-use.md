# How to use

## Getting Started

The Primitive Color Builder helps you create perceptually uniform color scales based on human color perception, not just mathematical interpolation.

## Adding Color Scales

- Click "Add color scale" to create a new color scale
- Choose your base color using the color picker
- Adjust the number of swatches in your scale (3-15 swatches)
- Select different color spaces (OKLCH, OKLAB, LCH, LAB, HSL) to see how they affect interpolation
- Test

## Understanding Color Spaces

- **OKLCH/OKLAB:** Modern perceptually uniform color spaces (recommended)
- **LCH/LAB:** Traditional perceptually uniform color spaces
- **HSL:** Hue-Saturation-Lightness, familiar but not perceptually uniform

## Color Families

Generate harmonious color families based on your existing color scales:

- Click "Add color families" to open the harmony generator
- Choose from complementary, analogous, triadic, and other color harmonies
- Preview generated colors before adding them to your palette

## Exporting Your Palette

- Click "Export" to download your color scales
- Choose from multiple export formats (CSS, JSON, Tailwind, etc.)
- Copy individual color values by clicking on swatches

## Tips

- Use OKLCH for the most perceptually uniform results
- Test your colors in both light and dark modes using the theme toggle
- Check contrast ratios to ensure accessibility
- Experiment with different harmony methods to find complementary colors
